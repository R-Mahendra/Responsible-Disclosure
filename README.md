# 🛡️ Responsible Disclosure – Ignored, Rejected, Silently Patched

This repository documents security vulnerabilities I responsibly disclosed to various companies, platforms, and services — but were:

- ❌ Ignored or rejected without valid reasoning  
- 💬 Responded with vague templates  
- 🩹 Silently patched afterwards without acknowledgment  
- 💸 No bounty or recognition given, despite valid and exploitable findings

---

- I'm not asking for prizes.
- I'm not asking for applause.
- I'm just asking for clarity.

I want this record to last forever , because safety is not just about repairs, it's about attitude.

# 🧠 Why This Exists

As a security researcher and bug bounty hunter, I believe in **responsible disclosure**.  
But when vendors repeatedly dismiss reports and quietly fix the issues without transparency, documentation becomes necessary.

This repository serves as:

- A public timeline of ignored-but-fixed vulnerabilities  
- A case study archive for future researchers  
- A warning to vendors: **patches speak louder than templates**

# 💣 Disclosure Philosophy
> I'm not here to embarrass companies. I'm here to expose patterns.
A single rejection can be a mistake. 
A silent patch after rejection is negligence. 
patches without acknowledgment is a pattern worth documenting.
